# Bugreport
This document contents 4 lists with bug reports.

List 1. Test drive. This is the bug report for module for Mercedes' test drive registration. This is Anderson's testing platform for future QA 

engineer. I did it after graduated SkillUp courses. 
List 2. Sativa. This is my study bug report. I did it when I was studing at SkillUp. The aim of this project was finding by myself bugs at any 

existing sites and then do bug reports for finding bugs in Jira.
List 3. Menu.by. It is the part of previous report for courses. I couldn't find other interesting bugs at the sativa.by, so I diceded try to do 

it at menu.by. 
List 4. Instagram. I've found this bug when I was doing checklist for "Settings" function. So our QA teacher ask to do bug report for this bug.
